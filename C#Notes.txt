BUILT-IN VARIBABLE TYPES
int - Integers (whole numbers, positive and negative)
string - Strings (a sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, or symbols)
float - Floating point numbers (numbers that use decimals)
double - Double precision floating point numbers (just like a float, except it takes up twice as much memory, so it can hold larger numbers or numbers with more decimal places)
bool - Boolean variables (true or false)

INPUTS

C#: Console.Write("What is your favorite color? ");
    string color = Console.ReadLine();
